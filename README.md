# Toilet Finder
This is a WIP crowd- and open-source public toilet finder. We plan to implement a rating and status system.

## Problem
Many public restrooms are out-of-order, very dirty, or not accesible.

## Solution
To feature a crowd-sourced review and status system, where people can add toilets onto the map, rate them, and add them into categories such as disability-friendly, out-of-order, and such. Also to make it convenient to search for toilets near to the user by using Open Route Service isochrones/matrix services.

## UI
Web Next.js UI using leaflet
Mobile Kotlin Multiplatform using carto
